## Fraud Transaction Detection
In this project, we use the BankSim dataset to detect fraudulent transactions. We perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset, preprocess the data, and train an XGBoost model to classify transactions as fraudulent or not.

### Dataset
The BankSim dataset contains simulated transaction data from a mobile payment service. The dataset consists of 594,643 transactions, each with 10 features including step, age, gender, category, merchant, and amount. The target variable is a binary label indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. The dataset is provided in a CSV file.
